Full Stack Task 

We want you to create a simple website for display country data. You will use the public API; https://restcountries.eu/and the attached designs to accomplish this.
On the frontend, you'll need to create a website using your preferred JS framework that will consume data from your backend to display a list of countries with very basic data about each. The user should be able to search for a country using the input field and also filter the countries by region.
The website should be fully responsive to work on all screen size.
Don't worry about implementing the dark mode toggle, but we'll be impressed if you do!
On the backend, we want to consume the public API, but we don't want to unnecessarily make more requests to the API than we need to (imagine it has a small usage quota). Therefore, create a middleware/backend that makes the requests to the public API and then caches the data for an amount of time that you think is recommended.

Frontend Extension Task
Allow the user to click on a country to see more details about it. This should navigate to another page for that country with further details, and also links to each of the countries border countries.

Backend Extension Task
Create a NoSQL data model that would represent a continent or states/province/region or city (you can choose one of them)
